# Experimentation with the implementation of the remote rehabilitation system architecture using the Exertiles game framework. 

This is the repository for the implementation of the remote rehabilitation system architecture using the Exertiles game framework.  The solution is intended to demonstrate the shared database solution in our master's thesis, "Remote Follow-up of Patients using Exergames in Physical Therapy."The application illustrates how the data is shared between the frontend and backend developed in React and Unity for the Exertiles framework. Both sides use Node.js to manipulate, retrieve, and upload data to the shared database.


1.  **Remote rehabilitation system**
    The rehabilitation system is used for the purpose of remote follow-up of elderly patients. This user interface is intended to be used by physiotherapists to keep track of patientsâ€™ progression and results from the exercise game. 
      

2.  **Status and prerequisites** 
    The following environment must be downloaded in order to test this project:

    - **Node.js** 

    - **Unity X.X** 

    - **React X.X**
